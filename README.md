# Koup
Loyalty Points System

**#Background**
Here in Kenya it is difficult to track loyalty points across various vendors and also transfer the said points to friends and family. Therefore we developed the Koup-Loyalty Points System to solve this problem.

**#Solution**
Koup allows you to receive loyalty points from a supermarket and you can be able to spend those points in the same supermarket or transfer them to another user who is subscribed to the same supermarket.

A user can also view the ledger of their own points and help them make a decision on spending or transfer.
